# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
Credit card fraud is increasing considerably with the development of modern technology. Here we mainly focus on credit fraud transactions in real world. Initially we will collect the credit card dataset and then the dataset will be analysed and processed. After that random forest algorithm is applied for obtaining the accuracy of the dataset. Finally the number of Fraud transactions present in the dataset will be identified. The performance of the techniques is evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision. The accuracy of the resultant dataset obtained is about 98%.
